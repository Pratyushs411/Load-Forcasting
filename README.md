## üìä Dataset

- **Source:** [Electricity Load Forecasting Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/electricity-load-forecasting/data)
- **Description:** Data of various weather variables, such as temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and wind speed, for three main cities in Panama, from Earthdata.
- **Columns:**
  - `Datetime`: Timestamp of the load data
  - `Load`: Actual electricity load in MW

## üß† Models Implemented

1. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
   - Captures long-term dependencies in time series.
   - Handles vanishing gradient problem better than vanilla RNNs.

2. **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**
   - Simpler and faster alternative to LSTM with comparable performance.
   - Uses update and reset gates.

3. **GRU + Attention Mechanism**
   - Enhances GRU by allowing the model to focus on relevant time steps dynamically.
   - Improves interpretability and forecasting accuracy.
